    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>225g wheat flour</li>
      <li>125ml water</li>
      <li>Pasturized tomatoes</li>
      <li>Gouda cheese</li>
      <li>15ml olive oil</li>
      <li>10g salt</li>
      <li>15g suggar</li>
      <li>15g Yeast</li>
      <li>Optional:</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Toppings of your choice, for example:</li>
      <li>Salami and champignons, bacon and ananas, tuna and onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the wheat, water, olive oil, salt, suggar and yeast</li>
      <li>Either knead the dough in a kitchen helper or do it by hand</li>
      <li>A kitchen helper should take about 4-7 min</li>
      <li>
        Doing it by hand is simple, just start kneading it with your hand until
        it becomes dough, then take the ends and pull them into the middle,
        apply some pressure. Imagine giving a massage
      </li>
      <li>
        You will know if the dough is done, if you take a piece and try to
        stretch it softly with your fingers. If it easily tears, its not done.
        If you stretch it and its almost a see through texture, then its done.
        It should feel soft to touch and not wet and sticky anymore
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to make a ball shape of the dough and put a towel over it so it
        doesnt become hard
      </li>
      <li>Let it rest for about 10-15 minutes at room temperature</li>
      <li>Heat your oven to 240-250°C</li>
      <li>Start rolling the pizza with a rolling pin</li>
      <li>Now start by putting some pasturized tomatoes on your dough</li>
      <li>
        Next add the topping of your choice. For example salami, tuna, bacon,
        bolognese
      </li>
      <li>
        Add gouda on top. If you want, you can put gouda on the edges and roll
        the dough inwards to get a cheese filled crust
      </li>
      <li>Add some oregano on top of it and put it in the heated oven</li>
      <li>Let it bake for about 15-20 minutes</li>
      <li>Bon Appétit</li>
    </ol>
